[Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com) – the new Mac App we've been working on – is finally available [on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deckset-turn-your-notes-into/id847496013?ls=1&mt=12). Deckset turns simple Markdown into beautiful looking presentations.

I've been working on this app for the last half year together with [Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and the folks at [A Color Bright](http://acolorbright.com). Together we've achieved so much more than what Chris and I envisioned when we first started this project. And there's so much more we want to do. But first it's time now to get Deckset into the hands of more people.

If you like the efficiency of text-based workflows and would like to leverage the same for creating presentations, you can learn more about Deckset on our [new website](http://decksetapp.com). I especially recommend checking out the gorgeous [themes page](http://decksetapp.com/themes)!
