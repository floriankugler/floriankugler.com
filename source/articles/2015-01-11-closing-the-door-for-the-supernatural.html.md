title: Closing the Door for the Supernatural

Scientists leave the door open because of the idea that a positive cannot be disproved.

However, if it's impossible to prove the positive, it can be dismissed immediately.

This is the situation with gods and religious phenomena. If could could be proven to exist, it wouldn't be god anymore because it's now a natural phenomenon.

The same goes for every supernatural concept.

So keep closing the doors. The delusion of the supernatural is a distraction to real happiness, finding purpose, having relationships.
