title: Core Data Book in Early Access
published: true

Over the last months I've been working on a [new book about Core Data](http://www.objc.io/books/core-data) together with [Daniel](https://twitter.com/danielboedewadt) under the [objc.io](http://www.objc.io) umbrella. Since yesterday it's available as [early access version](http://www.objc.io/books/core-data) -- we've got a lot of great content lined up that we're going to release chapter by chapter over the next weeks.

I'm really enjoying working on this project. It's a good combination of writing code for the example app we're building, technical writing, and digging around in Core Data to learn more about its inner workings. Additionally, I've been working mostly from home for this project, which I plan on doing more of in the future. I really like the flexibility of structuring my day as I please, and -- that's a big one -- cooking my own food instead of having lunch out every day.

Writing this book has also been part of a bigger effort of reinventing [objc.io](http://www.objc.io), after we've decided to take a break from the [monthly issues](http://www.objc.io/issues) for the time being. We started with a complete redesign of the website done by [Paulo](https://twitter.com/paulozoom), followed by the early access release of the [Advanced Swift book](http://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift) book, and now the [Core Data book](http://www.objc.io/books/core-data). And we already have new ideas we want to explore.
