title: SOS â€“ A Misguided Apple Watch Ad
published: true

Apple released a bunch of new ads for the Apple Watch recently. One of those, titled "Beijing", particularly stood out to me, and not in a positive way. The clip below starts right at the segment I'm referring to.

I imagine that those ads go through lots of iterations and many different options are considered, before they finally get signed off by people pretty high up in the management. To me it speaks volumes about the times we live in that this segment made it into the final clip and apparently was considered to be an appealing story to tell.

(If you haven't watched it yet, watch it now so that you know what I'm talking about. It's just 7 seconds.)

May I make a radical suggestion: if you have the time and leisure to doodle the letters "SOS" on a tiny display after fiddling around with the crown to select the right person from the contacts list, how about simply saying that you're not interested and walking away? You know, like a mature adult.

The people who decided to use this scene clearly thought that it would help in painting a picture of a young, exciting, and fun lifestyle -- one they'd like to associate with Apple Watch. To me this scene symbolizes insecurity and immaturity, packaged as a virtue and shipped to millions of people with the stamp of approval of the Apple logo.

I get that it can be difficult to be honest and assertive, but that's exactly why positive examples in this regard are even more important. Putting the modern version of the rescue call on display like this is disempowering.
