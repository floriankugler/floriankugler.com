Happy new year!

Over the last ten days I've spent some time reconsidering the purpose of my personal blog, after I hadn't published much here over the past year.

Since I started [objc.io](http://www.objc.io) in June 2013 with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [Daniel](https://twitter.com/danielboedewadt), I have directed all my efforts in technical writing towards it --- both by contributing my own articles as well as by doing editorial work. As a result it has been pretty quiet around here apart from occasional announcements.

I want this to change.

I still enjoy technical writing, but I'm deeply interested in and passionate about other topics as well. Since my technical writing already has a home at objc.io, I will use my personal blog to write about other topics from now on.

Developing software has been part of my life since 20 years, but my interests have always extended beyond the world of technology. Over the last years I've especially been drawn to philosophy, psychology, and economics in the quest to better understand and to improve myself, my relationships, and the world around me.

I plan to pick topics as I encounter them in life, ranging from very personal issues to issues in society at large. Some of it will be kicking around ideas or mere personal opinions, while other parts will be examinations based on more rigorous philosophical principles.

I hope it's going to be thought provoking, insightful, and challenging.
