Never before have the critics of religion been as visible and as outspoken as they are today. People like [Sam Harris](http://www.samharris.org), [Richard Dawkins](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins), and [Lawrence Krauss](https://twitter.com/lkrauss1) have sold millions of books arguing for reason and against religion, and YouTube is a seemingly endless source of their debates with members of various religions.

However, most of them, good scientists that they are, keep a door open, since negatives cannot be proven. To take a famous example, claiming that a [teapot is orbiting the sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot) without any evidence may be irrational, but proving the contrary is impossible. As unlikely as the hypothesis may seem, science can not preclude it with 100% certainty --- absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. In other words, they cannot prove that god does *not* exist.

I disagree with this position. I think we *can* close that last door with confidence.

The notion that a negative cannot be proven hinges on whether the corresponding positive *can* be proven. To take [Russel's teapot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot) as an example: we cannot prove that it's not orbiting the sun somewhere, because it's impossible to look everywhere at the same time. Therefore we say that we don't have evidence for its existence, but we cannot be certain of its non-existence, because a simple positive observation would settle the case. However, if there would be *no* methodology to positively prove the teapot's existence, we could be absolutely sure of its non-existence.

I will argue that god, or any other supernatural entity for that matter, is exactly like that: it's a teapot that cannot possibly be proven to exist.

The heart of the issue is the concept of the supernatural itself. Metaphysically it seems impossible to define the supernatural. Any definition of the term has to rely on using its antithesis --- the natural --- in some form or another, since that is all we know. However, this makes the term supernatural synonymous to non-existence, since everything we gain knowledge about by definition moves into the realm of the natural, or simply the existing.

Any god or any supernatural phenomenon relies on having some kind of effect on the natural world --- something we can perceive or measure --- in order to be relevant at all. Once something has an effect on the natural world though, it has by definition moved from the supernatural to the natural world, or from non-existence to existence.

With this line being crossed, the previous attribution to the supernatural is lost. We wouldn't call anything measurable in the natural world a god. It would simply be a natural phenomenon, a really powerful space alien, or something like that.

This is precisely why we can close the last door with 100% confidence: There cannot be a positive proof for the existence of a god, because no proof for *anything* supernatural can exist. Having proof for something automatically moves that thing into the natural realm, stripping its status of being supernatural. A god for which we would have prove wouldn't be a god.

While it might be entertaining to debate the historical accuracy, ethical standards, or compatibility with modern science of ancient books, at the end of the day all this is irrelevant to the basic issue at hand.

Any god --- and anything else labeled supernatural for that matter --- is a self-contradictory concept. It has been defined out of existence from the very beginning.

So keep closing the doors.
