title: Statistics and You

There are generally three different ways of acquiring knowledge:

1. Logic
2. Experience
3. Science

Logic allows us to derive axiomatic truths that are true independent of empirical validations, such as `2 + 2 = 4`. Personal experience is the kind of knowledge each of us accumulates by processing sense data and introspection. Lastly, science is the process of acquiring knowledge by testing hypothesis using objective measurements and statistics. 

Speaking from my own personal experience, scientific knowledge is often regarded to be more valuable than the the other two types, especially than knowledge won from personal experience. While there is truth to that in certain contexts, I think the value of scientific knowledge is overrated and misunderstood when it comes to decisions in your own life.

The method of empirical scientific investigation --- gaining knowledge derived from objective and repeatable measurements --- works great in the realm of inanimate things. It has brought tremendous scientific and technical progress, and improved the quality of life of many. The results become more complicated and more fraught with uncertainty and all kinds of caveats the more complex the subject of investigation is.

Whenever you do empirical research, you collect data that has to be analyzed, to which end you turn statistics. [Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) can be [descriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_statistics), such as the mean value or the standard deviation of a data set, or [inferential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference), i.e. you draw conclusions from data that's subject to some random variation and generalize those conclusions beyond the sample you investigated.

I want to shine a light specifically on how conclusions drawn from inferential statistics are or are not helpful to make decisions in your personal life. 

Let's take some fictional nutritional advice as an example --- an area where there's a seemingly endless stream of supposedly scientifically based advice thrown at us, and which directly affects our quality of life. 

Imagine you read about a study that showed that you're 50% more likely to become overweight when eating a carbohydrate rich vs. a low carbohydrate diet. Leaving all questions about such a study's methodology as well as the existence of potentially conflicting evidence aside, you could easily conclude that you're faced with the following dilemma in light of these new findings:

> I really do like my mediterranean, carbohydrate rich diet, but is my short-term pleasure worth the 50% increased risk of becoming overweight in the long run?

The fundamental problem with this conclusion is this: the fact that a study found a 50% increased risk examining a sample of people and applying inferential statistics to the data, does *not* mean that you as an individual are at a 50% greater risk as well.

As mentioned above, inferential statistics is used to draw conclusions from data that's subject to some random variation. Since the human body is extremely complex and there's a lot of intra-individual variation in terms of physiology and environmental influences, it's no surprise that the connection between two simple variables --- carbohydrate intake and body weight --- is subject to a large amount of "random" variation.

The issue is though that this variation is not really random. We just treat it as such because of our own limitations of knowledge. If you'd look more closely at the group who showed the increased risk, you'd probably find quite a lot of variation in how the diet affected their weight. You  might even find subjects who lost weight. Those variations are not random, but they have causes that we don't understand or choose to ignore for the purpose of such a study.

While you can make a statistical statement about the increased risk for a certain population, you cannot pin a number on yourself as an individual, because you don't know the reasons for the variation and where you would fall on this spectrum yourself.

This is where personal experience and self knowledge are often a much better basis for decisions than empirical findings. If we care to pay attention to it, we have access to a huge amount of information about ourselves based on which we can make much more informed decisions than by looking at science.

We don't have do discount the value of personal experience to acknowledge the value of science. They are both tools that serve different purposes and complement each other. 

Science is a great tool to advance technology and quality of life in the grand scheme of things. I think personal experience though is mostly the better tool to make the best decisions in your personal life.
