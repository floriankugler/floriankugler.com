Every now and then there comes a moment where the momentum of what you've been doing has ceased and a variety of different paths open up in front of you. Then it's time to reflect on what you have achieved, what's important to you and what makes you happy.

My last year was pretty eventful: [objc.io](http://www.objc.io) kept growing, we released [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com) in April, authored a [book](http://www.objc.io/books) over the summer and published it in October, and finally we started working on a [new project](https://twitter.com/getscenery) that's due for release soon. Nevertheless, it's time again to make a conscious decision where all of this should go in the future, instead of just coasting along.

The verdict isn't out yet, so that's not the topic of this article. Rather, it's a way for me personally to lay out a framework that's the basis for my considerations. And maybe it's useful for you too.

For me there are two basic dimensions to a decision like this: the *content* and the *structure* of my work. Let's examine the content dimension first.

The first way of looking at the content of my work is to zoom out --- taking a look at my work in the context of my life as a whole. What are my ambitions in life? Where do I want to make a difference in the world? Has my work contributed towards this?

Although these questions are sometimes hard to answer, I think it's worthwhile reflecting on them regularly. Otherwise it's easy to just coast along --- jumping on opportunities as they present themselves --- without ever steering towards your broader goals and values. Meanwhile, the groove in which your life is progressing gets carved out bit by bit, almost imperceptible, and it gets harder and harder to change course.

When I'm comfortable with the general direction of what I'm working on, I can take a closer look at the details. It's kind of like the branches of the tree: once you've decided among the thicker ones further down, all kinds of smaller branches present themselves. I usually find this the much easier part, since those decisions are mostly more tangible and have more predictable outcomes.

With regard to the *structure* of my work, there are many factors to consider, but at the end of the day it comes down to a simple question: How much freedom do I want to have? Which freedoms are I willing to give up in pursuit of a goal?

Freedom or the constraint thereof is affected by many factors: time and work place flexibility, responsibility, accountability, and overall stress, to just name a few examples. Those factors can vary greatly depending on whether you work for yourself or with a small team, locally or remotely, with your own money or with investors' money, with or without employees, etc.

I like to look at this aspect in the broader context of what makes me happy in my life other than what I'm working on: for example spending time with my wife, having time to learn and to grow, being able to schedule my work flexibly, and being able to work from home when I feel like it.
