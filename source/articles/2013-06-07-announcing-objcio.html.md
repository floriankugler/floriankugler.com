Today I'm very happy to announce a new project for the iOS & Mac developer community I have been working on together with [Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [Daniel Eggert](https://twitter.com/danielboedewadt): [objc.io](http://www.objc.io).

objc.io is a periodical about best practices and advanced techniques in Objective-C. Each edition will focus on one topic with several articles covering different aspects of it. Head over to the [objc.io website](http://www.objc.io) to check out the first edition!

We already have teamed up with great developers from the Objective-C community for upcoming editions: [Loren Brichter](https://twitter.com/lorenb), [Peter Steinberger](https://twitter.com/steipete), [Brent Simmons](https://twitter.com/brentsimmons) and [Ole Begemann](https://twitter.com/olebegemann) are on board for contributing articles in the future!

Please [get in touch with us](mailto:mail@objc.io) if you would like to contribute an article to objc.io!
