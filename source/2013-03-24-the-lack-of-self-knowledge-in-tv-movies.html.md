title: The Lack of Self Knowledge in TV & Movies

I recently realized the complete lack of positive role models in television series or movies when it comes to self knowledge and self development.

The pattern of how the journey to happiness of most characters is constructed is remarkably similar, and totally destructive. Happiness is portrayed as something external, e.g. meeting the right partner, finding the right job, getting children, becoming wealthy, ...

We don't see any processing of why somebody was in a crappy relationship in the first place, no mourning about having made these mistakes and wasted years of his or her life, no processing of childhood traumata, no becoming aware of unconscious patterns &mdash; no gaining self knowledge. It's all portrayed as a matter of not having committed yourself enough, not having tried hard enough, not having become lucky yet.

Without self knowledge we are caught up in the unconscious patterns which were formed by our parents, siblings, peers, relatives, teachers, priests, politicians &mdash; and in many cases hours and hours of [television consumption every day](http://www.statista.com/statistics/214353/average-daily-tv-viewing-time-per-person-in-selected-countries/ "Average daily TV viewing time per person in selected countries"). We are destined to repeat the same mistakes over and over if we are not willing to ask the uncomfortable questions why we make these mistakes in the first place.

It's sad that the television and movie industry doesn't provide better role models. With many hours of viewing time every day they have an enormous influence on the development of children and the potential to give them better examples. Instead avoidance of true self knowledge and all kinds of superstitions are twisted into virtues. It's not really surprising though, because seeing characters go through this process would confront people with their own lack of self knowledge and therefore make them extremely uncomfortable &mdash; not a great recipe for capturing many viewers.

But maybe there are also good examples out there I'm not aware of? Please let me know!
