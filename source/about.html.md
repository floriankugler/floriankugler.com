# About Me

Hi -- My name is Florian and I live in Berlin, Germany.

I'm currently working as a software developer and technical author in the iOS and Mac ecosystems. Please see my [projects](/projects.html) page for more details on what I've been working on.

Besides my current professional ventures I'm a deeply curious person and a rational thinker in many fields. First of all, I love to learn more about myself to become a better person. I also love to learn about philosophy, economics, politics, and many related topics to understand the world we're living in and to work towards a better future.

Although I've been developing software for more than 20 years now, I've pursued lots of other endeavours as well.

As a kid I was on my way to becoming a classical flute player. At the age of 18 I found my passion for sports and started to intensively practice [Aikido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido) for several years. Afterwards I started to train as a [cyclist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle_racing) and finally ended up doing [triathlon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon). I still enjoy training today, although on a less rigorous schedule.

My not so straightforward academic path just started after working as a freelancer for a few years by studying computer science and physics. But soon I dropped the latter to pursue the former. Eventually, I added sports science as a second subject and graduated in 2009. Afterwards I worked at university as research assistant in [sports biomechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_biomechanics).

After a while I decided to leave the world of academia. During my time as a student I had co-founded an elite sports consulting company that I now joined full-time. We mainly worked in track and field as well as in soccer with a focus on individual development and movement technique.

It was one of my partners in this company who first introduced me to [Austrian Economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School), which proved to be the gateway drug for me to studying self-knowledge and philosophy.

After three exciting and educational years I left the company, joined forces with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and started to work on my own [projects](/projects.html).
