# About Me

Hi -- My name is Florian and I live in Berlin, Germany.

I'm currently working as a software developer and technical author in the iOS and Mac ecosystems. Please see my [projects](/projects.html) page for more details on what I've been working on.

Besides my current professional ventures I'm a deeply curious person with interests in many fields. I love to study philosophy, psychology, and economics to better understand and to improve myself, my relationships, and the world around me.

Although I've been developing software for more than 20 years now, I pursued many other endeavours in my life as well.

As a kid I was on my way to becoming a classical flute player. At the age of 18 I discovered my passion for sports and started to intensively practice [Aikido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido) for several years. Afterwards I got into [cycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle_racing) and finally ended up doing [triathlon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon). I still enjoy training today, although on a less rigorous schedule.

My academic path started off a bit late after I had worked as a freelancer for a few years out of high school. Initially I couldn't decide between studying computer science and physics. But soon I dropped the latter to pursue the former. Eventually, I took up sports science as a second subject, graduated in 2009, and continued to work at university as research assistant in [sports biomechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_biomechanics).

After a while I decided to leave the world of academia. During my time as a student I had co-founded an elite sports consulting company that I now joined full-time. We mainly worked in track and field as well as in soccer with a focus on individual development and teaching movement technique.

It was one of my partners in this company who first introduced me to [Austrian Economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School). This proved to be the gateway drug to exploring self-knowledge and philosophy later on, which have contributed greatly to my happiness today.

After three exciting and educational years I left the company in early 2013 and joined forces with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and, shortly after that, [A Color Bright](http://acb.io). I'm working on my own [projects](/projects.html) since.
