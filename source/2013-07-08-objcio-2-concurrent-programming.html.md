I have been pretty quiet during the last weeks on my blog, but there is a good reason for it: We just published [objc.io issue #2](http://www.objc.io).

In this issue we are taking on the topic of concurrent programming, which turned out to be a quite an undertaking. But I think the result is great. Head over to [objc.io](http://www.objc.io) and let me know what you think!
