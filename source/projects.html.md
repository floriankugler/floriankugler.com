# Projects

## Core Data

In 2015 I started writing a book about Core Data with [Daniel Eggert](https://twitter.com/danielboedewadt) under the [objc.io](http://www.objc.io) umbrella. It will be available as early access version soon, with the final version coming later this summer. Sign up for the [objc.io newsletter](http://www.objc.io/newsletter/) to be notified. The book is focused around showing best practices by example, from simple persistency tasks to multithreading and syncing. 

## Scenery

[Scenery](https://twitter.com/getscenery) is a Mac App that makes it super easy to showcase your designs in beautiful product photography. As Deckset, Scenery is also a cooperation with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [A Color Bright](http://acb.io).  

## Functional Programming in Swift

I co-authored this book about functional programming techniques with Apple's new programming language [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) together with [Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [Wouter Swierstra](https://twitter.com/wouterswierstra). It's available since October 2013 as [eBook](http://www.objc.io/books/fpinswift) and as [paperback](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3000480056/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=3000480056&linkCode=as2&tag=objcio-20&linkId=TC2ZNZVZRAE73TNB).

## Deckset

[Deckset](http://decksetapp.com) is a presentation app for the Mac that creates beautiful slides from simple markdown documents. It's a co-production with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [A Color Bright](http://acb.io) and launched in April 2014.

## objc.io

[objc.io](http://www.objc.io) is an online magazine about best practices and advanced techniques for iOS and Mac developers. I co-founded objc.io in June 2013 together with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [Daniel](https://twitter.com/danielboedewadt). After two years and 24 issues we've decided to [take a break](http://www.objc.io/blog/2015/06/05/welcome/) from this format and focus more on [long form writing](http://www.objc.io/books).

## Talks

I've regularly spoken on technical topics at iOS and Mac developer conferences. Check out my [Speaker Deck page](https://speakerdeck.com/floriankugler) for a selection of talks.
