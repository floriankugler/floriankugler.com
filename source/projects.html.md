## Scenery

[Scenery](https://twitter.com/getscenery) is a new app I'm currently working on with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [A Color Bright](http://acb.io). We don't have more details to share yet, but it will be out in early 2015!

## Functional Programming in Swift

I co-authored this book about functional programming techniques with Apple's new programming language [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) together with [Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [Wouter Swierstra](https://twitter.com/wouterswierstra). It's available since October 2013 as [eBook](http://www..objc.io/books) and as [paperback](http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Swift-Chris-Eidhof/dp/3000480056/).

## Deckset

[Deckset](http://decksetapp.com) is a presentation app for the Mac that creates beautiful slides from simple markdown documents. It's a co-production with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [A Color Bright](http://acb.io) and launched in April 2014.

## objc.io

[objc.io](http://www.objc.io) is an online magazine about best practices and advanced techniques for iOS and Mac developers. I co-founded objc.io in June 2013 together with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [Daniel](https://twitter.com/danielboedewadt).
