title: "Building a Mac App: Deckset"

The last months I've been working together with [Chris](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and the folks at [A Color Bright](http://www.acolorbright.com) on a new project: [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com).

Deckset is a native Mac app that turns a simple Markdown file into beautiful slides. I've already used it for some talks in the past weeks, and I really enjoyed how I could leverage the power of my favorite text editor to draft the story of my presentation, without having to fiddle around with the slides.

Deckset is not meant to replace Keynote or Powerpoint, it's a different way to create presentations. It has its own set of trade-offs in terms of productivity and flexibility. From our own experience though, it's a good set of trade-offs in many cases. And it's a lot of fun to use!

In the process of building this app, I also got to learn a lot about developing for the Mac. It's a whole different beast than iOS, to say the least... but it's great to build software for the platform I'm spending the most time on. We're already thinking of a future [objc.io](http://www.objc.io) issue with really good articles for iOS developers wanting to get their feet wet with the Mac.

But back to Deckset: We're not quite done yet, but we're almost ready for beta testing. If you like the idea of Deckset, head over to [decksetapp.com](http://www.decksetapp.com) and subscribe for future updates.
