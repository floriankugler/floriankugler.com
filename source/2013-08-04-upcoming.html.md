This fall I'm going to speak at [NSSpain](http://www.nsspain.com) and at [Macoun](http://www.macoun.de).

[NSSpain](http://www.nsspain.com) takes place at September 17th to 19th in Logro√±o. I will be there together with my [objc.io](http://www.objc.io) friends [Chris Eidhof](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof) and [Daniel Eggert](https://twitter.com/danielboedewadt). In my talk I will expand on an [earlier blog post](/blog/2013/5/24/layer-trees-vs-flat-drawing-graphics-performance-across-ios-device-generations) regarding drawing and compositing performance on various iOS devices.

Ping me if you would like to attend NSSpain, I might have a 10% discount code for you.

[Macoun](http://www.macoun.de) is a german speaking conference in Frankfurt, taking place at October 5th to 6th. There I will talk about parallel programming, a topic which we recently [covered in detail in objc.io](http://www.objc.io/issue-2).

Say hello if you're attending any of these events!
